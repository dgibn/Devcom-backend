The main project is named LHC
The app name is mainapp
The folder api consists of all the endpints api's created including the serializers as well as the urls and endpoints.
The database model where the data is stored is named "Bookings".
I installed the rest_framework and added to the installed apps as well as my mainapp.
I installed the django rest framework packages.
The endpoints are "newbookings" in order to add the data,"existing" in order to list the bookings on a particular date and "cancelbooking" in order to delete an existing booking.
